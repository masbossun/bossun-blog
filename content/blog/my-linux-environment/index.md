## Experience using Linux

I have been using linux as my daily basis operating system for about 6 months from 2018. Actually i used to use windows-based operating system for about 8 years, from windows xp to seven to 8 to 8.1 and lastly windows 10. But in the middle year of 2016 i learnt another operating system with \*NIX based kernel called Linux. My first linux distro that i dual-booted to my disk is Ubuntu (i forgot the version of it). Since then i get used to using terminal and get rid all of the GUI-things and change to CLI and i feel more powerful at that time, and that is true because i am feeling just like hacker (LOL, all geek-kid dreams).

But then the problems is come, first, a lot of features of Windows are not available or not so powerful on Linux such as Microsoft Office. Second my laptop disk is cannot accommodate any other data because i use separate disk partition for linux. third, at that time i feel like i not so needed the linux operation as my daily OS. So i deleted all my disk's partition with linux os inside.

Back then when i started studying in university, i learnt linux again at 4th semester in Network Security Class. at that class we use linux as operating system to protect the network and so on. I felt like i getting comfortable again with linux, so i was install it again on my disk. After a while i find and try many distros to fit my needs and my laptop. I have try [arch](), [manjaro](), [centos](), [ubuntu](), and many other arch-based distros. I tried many distro because there is always a problem to come such as the EFI issue, kernel issue, etc. Then until i found that debian-based ubuntu is more stable for my requirements. So i installed ubuntu at version 18.10 on my disks. In a month of usage, i have spent a lot of time to use this distro than my windows OS. I started to install all my environment again, i installed all my development apps again, and use it in my daily basis. On another month i decide to remove all my disk's data and just install one operating system that i need, and i found the [Pop_OS!]() the ubuntu-based distro for development. I download it and install to my disk as a primary and the only one operating system.

In my journey to find the best distro i always filled all my installed linux with the same environment. So i experienced with many plugins or theme-related apps on many distro. Right now i am using the Pop_OS! from [system76](), the official website says that the OS is focused for a developers. When i use it i find the feeling is the same when i use ubuntu, until now i can't find what is the different between them. They make some [article]() tho to show the different between their OS and Ubuntu, but in my usage i can't see any different. But because it stable and fit my needs, i decide to get along with this distro.

## My linux environment

My linux environment is basically a lot of themed-related apps, because i find making the operating system just like what i want can makes me happy. I change all the aspects in my linux to be different. I subscribe to popular \*NIX Desktop Art in reddit called [/r/unixporn]() to find the inspiration about the theme and apps to theming the desktop of my linux. I have tried to use many Desktop Environment like [GNOME](), [OpenBox](), [i3-block](), [awesome](), etc. But i found the i3-block is very good for theming, after i use for development-usage i found not so comfortable with it and rather to switch back to GNOME.

And down below i listed all my environment in my linux distro.

- Terminal
  - Terminal App: Terminator
  - Bash: ZSH with oh-my-zsh
  - Plugins: git and zsh-syntax-highlighting
